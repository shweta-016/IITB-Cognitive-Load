#  Cognitive Load Detection using EEG and GSR
Project Description

This project focuses on detecting cognitive load levels using EEG (Electroencephalogram) brain signals and GSR (Galvanic Skin Response) data. The aim is to understand how physiological signals change with different levels of mental effort and to classify cognitive load using machine learning techniques.

The project is part of the IITB EdTech Internship 2025 – Track 1 (Educational Data Analysis) and is implemented at a student-friendly level with clear preprocessing, feature extraction, modeling, evaluation, and visualization steps.

# Objective

Extract meaningful features from EEG frequency bands and GSR signals

Train machine learning models to classify cognitive load

Evaluate model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

Visualize EEG and GSR patterns to understand physiological behavior

# Dataset Used

EEG.csv – EEG signals across multiple frequency bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma)

GSR.csv – Skin conductance measurements

PSY.csv – Task-related timestamps used for window-based analysis

# Results

The Random Forest model achieved reasonable accuracy in classifying cognitive load

Confusion matrix and feature importance plots were used for evaluation

EEG and GSR visualizations showed noticeable variations related to cognitive activity
